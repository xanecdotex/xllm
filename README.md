## 1. Project Overview

**xLLM** is an **efficient LLM inference framework**, specifically optimized for **Chinese AI accelerators**, enabling enterprise-grade deployment with enhanced efficiency and reduced cost. The framework adopts a **service-engine decoupled** inference architecture, achieving breakthrough efficiency through several  technologies: at the service layer, including elastic scheduling of online/offline requests, dynamic PD disaggregation, a hybrid EPD mechanism for multimodal and high-availability fault tolerance; and at the engine layer, combined with technologies such as multi-stream parallel computing, graph fusion optimization, speculative inference, dynamic load balancing and global KV cache management. The overall architecture is shown below:

<img src="docs/assets/xllm_arch.png" alt="xllm_arch" style="width:80%; height:auto;">
</div>

**xLLM** already supports efficient deployment of mainstream large models (such as *DeepSeek-V3.1*, *Qwen2/3*, etc.) on Chinese AI accelerators, empowering enterprises to implement high-performance, low-cost AI large model applications. xLLM has been fully deployed in JD.comâ€™s real core retail businesses, covering a variety of scenarios including intelligent customer service, risk control, supply chain optimization, ad recommendation, and more.


## 2. Core Features

**xLLM** delivers robust intelligent computing capabilities. By leveraging hardware system optimization and algorithm-driven decision control, it jointly accelerates the inference process, enabling high-throughput, low-latency distributed inference services.

**Full Graph Pipeline Execution Orchestration**
- Asynchronous decoupled scheduling at the requests scheduling layer, to reduce computational bubbles.
- Asynchronous parallelism of computation and communication at the model graph layer, overlapping computation and communication.
- Pipelining of heterogeneous computing units at the operator kernel layer, overlapping computation and memory access.

**Graph Optimization for Dynamic Shapes**
- Dynamic shape adaptation based on parameterization and multi-graph caching methods to enhance the flexibility of static graph.
- Controlled tensor memory pool to ensure address security and reusability.
- Integration and adaptation of performance-critical custom operators (e.g., *PageAttention*, *AllReduce*).

**Efficient Memory Optimization**
- Mapping management between discrete physical memory and continuous virtual memory.
- On-demand memory allocation to reduce memory fragmentation.
- Intelligent scheduling of memory pages to increase memory reusability.
- Adaptation of corresponding operators for domestic accelerators.

**Global KV Cache Management**
- Intelligent offloading and prefetching of KV in hierarchical caches.
- KV cache-centric distributed storage architecture.
- Intelligent KV routing among computing nodes.

**Algorithm-driven Acceleration**
- Speculative decoding optimization to improve efficiency through multi-core parallelism.
- Dynamic load balancing of MoE experts to achieve efficient adjustment of expert distribution.

## 4. Quick Start
#### Installation
First, download the image we provide:
```bash
# A2 x86
docker pull xllm/xllm-ai:xllm-0.6.0-dev-hb-rc2-py3.11-oe24.03-lts
# A2 arm
docker pull xllm/xllm-ai:xllm-0.6.0-dev-hb-rc2-py3.11-oe24.03-lts-aarch64
# A3 arm
docker pull xllm/xllm-ai:xllm-0.6.0-dev-hc-rc2-py3.11-oe24.03-lts-aarch64
# or
# A2 x86
docker pull quay.io/jd_xllm/xllm-ai:xllm-0.6.0-dev-hb-rc2-py3.11-oe24.03-lts
# A2 arm
docker pull quay.io/jd_xllm/xllm-ai:xllm-0.6.0-dev-hb-rc2-py3.11-oe24.03-lts-aarch64
# A3 arm
docker pull quay.io/jd_xllm/xllm-ai:xllm-0.6.0-dev-hc-rc2-py3.11-oe24.03-lts-aarch64
```
Then create the corresponding container:
```bash
sudo docker run -it --ipc=host -u 0 --privileged --name mydocker --network=host  --device=/dev/davinci0  --device=/dev/davinci_manager --device=/dev/devmm_svm --device=/dev/hisi_hdc -v /var/queue_schedule:/var/queue_schedule -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver:/usr/local/Ascend/driver -v /usr/local/Ascend/add-ons/:/usr/local/Ascend/add-ons/ -v /usr/local/sbin/npu-smi:/usr/local/sbin/npu-smi -v /usr/local/sbin/:/usr/local/sbin/ -v /var/log/npu/conf/slog/slog.conf:/var/log/npu/conf/slog/slog.conf -v /var/log/npu/slog/:/var/log/npu/slog -v /export/home:/export/home -w /export/home -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh  -v /var/log/npu/profiling/:/var/log/npu/profiling -v /var/log/npu/dump/:/var/log/npu/dump -v /home/:/home/  -v /runtime/:/runtime/ xllm/xllm-ai:xllm-0.6.0-dev-hb-rc2-py3.11-oe24.03-lts
```

Install official repo and submodulesï¼š
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm
cd xllm 
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
The compilation depends on [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg). The Docker image already includes VCPKG_ROOT preconfigured. If you want to manually set it up, you can:
```bash
git clone https://gitcode.com/xLLM-AI/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg && git checkout ffc42e97c866ce9692f5c441394832b86548422c
export VCPKG_ROOT=/your/path/to/vcpkg
```
Install python dependencies:
```bash
cd xllm
pip install -r cibuild/requirements-dev.txt -i https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple
pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
```

#### Compilation
When compiling, generate executable files `build/xllm/core/server/xllm` under `build/`:
```bash
python setup.py build
```
Or, compile directly using the following command to generate the whl package under `dist/`:
```bash
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

#### Launch
Run the following command to start xLLM engine: 
```bash
./build/xllm/core/server/xllm \    # launch xllm server
    --model=/path/to/your/llm  \   # model pathï¼ˆto replace with your own pathï¼‰
    --backend=llm \                # indicate the LLM backend
    --port=9977 \                  # set service port to 9977
    --max_memory_utilization 0.90  # set the maximal utilization of device memory
```
